# Math Dictionary

## Why
Some Math teachers were looking for a piece of technology to show the French and English definitions of Math terms with an accompanying image. The decision was made to include students in the creation of the site. This repo serves as a template for how this project could unfold. The student created website will be deployed internally for all of the middle school students to use.

## Technology
React is used to create this site. To keep things simple, the site will not use many of the tools often associated with a React project. The idea is to keep this as simple as possible so that the project will accessible to the largest number of students.

## Requirements
Student projects must contain the following:

* List view of all the words in the dictionary
  * Buttons to change language
  * Search box with live updates
* Definition view of the selected word
  * Title of the word to be defined
  * Image of the word defined
  * French definition
  * English definition
  * Buttons to cycle through the words and return to the list view
